# Simple. Technology

Hi! My name is Assaf Tzur-El. I am a software architect, developer, lecturer, and mentor (not necessarily in that order). I live in Israel and work (mostly remotely) all over the world. **Simple. Technology** is my official brand name, but I also provide my services via other companies.

I speacialize in taking projects and products to the next level: High-risk projects, technology stack updates, bleeding edge tech, or just computerizing a manual process into a single button-click.

TL;DR version of my career: 15 years in the hitech industry, from a developer to a team leader, architect, project namager and back. Then, in 2009, I became a freelance consultant, sharing my experience in software development while expanding my skill set to include teaching and mentoring. You can find my full résumé in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/assaftzurel/).
