title: "Exploring AI: Concepts, applications, and creation (workshop)"
---


Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized numerous industries, enabling remarkable achievements in natural language processing, machine learning, and the latest developments in the field of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). This workshop aims to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of key concepts in AI, ranging from machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLM) to GAI and hallucinations.

As part of the course, we will explore phenomena such as bias and hallucinations, as well as other crucial aspects of AI, including interpretability, ethics, fairness, explainability, and privacy. These phenomena play a pivotal role in shaping the responsible development and deployment of AI systems, and our discussions will provide valuable insights into their complexities and implications.

The workshop will feature live examples of various GAI services, showcasing the power and versatility of AI in today's world. Participants will have the opportunity to explore prominent AI models such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, and others, and learn various prompt engineering techniques. By dissecting and analyzing the inner workings of these models, attendees will gain practical insights into generating high-quality outputs and effectively leveraging AI services.

Moreover, the workshop will empower participants to create their own AI tools using cutting-edge technologies and APIs. Through hands-on sessions, attendees will delve into the utilization of OpenAI API, Azure AI, LangChain, and other prominent platforms. The workshop will guide participants through the process of harnessing the capabilities of these tools to develop AI solutions tailored to their specific needs.
