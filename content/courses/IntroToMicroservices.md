title: Introduction to microservices workshop
---

### Abstract:

Microservices have become a popular architectural style for developing large-scale applications. In this workshop, we will discuss the concept of microservices, its benefits and drawbacks, and how it differs from traditional monolithic architectures. We will explore the key principles of microservices such as independence, scalability, and fault tolerance. We will also examine the challenges of designing, testing, deploying, and monitoring microservices. Additionally, we will discuss the use of containerization and orchestration technologies like Docker and Kubernetes in microservices architecture.

In the practical part of the workshop, participants will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with microservices by coding, deploying, and managing a sample application. Throughout the practical part, participants will gain insights into the challenges and best practices associated with designing, developing, and deploying microservices. They will also learn techniques for testing microservices individually and as a system, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Additionally, we will explore approaches for monitoring and debugging microservices in a distributed environment, highlighting tools and practices that enable effective observability and troubleshooting.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will gain a solid understanding of microservices and will have hands-on experience with developing and managing microservices, allowing them to apply the concepts and techniques learned to their own projects or organizations.

### Target audience:

Software architects, developers, product owners, DevOps engineers, and anyone who is involved in the design, development, and deployment of large-scale applications.
