title: "Advanced Java programming with Spring"
---

This course is an intensive program that combines the power of advanced Java programming concepts with the versatility and productivity of the Spring framework. This comprehensive course is designed for experienced Java developers who want to elevate their skills and become proficient in building enterprise-grade applications using Spring.

The course begins by exploring advanced Java topics, including advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, design patterns, and architectural principles. Participants will dive into advanced Java features such as lambda expressions, functional interfaces, and streams, enabling them to write concise and expressive code. They will also learn how to apply SOLID principles and design patterns effectively to solve common software development challenges.

Building on this foundation, participants will delve into the Spring framework. They will learn how to leverage the core features of Spring, such as dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IoC), to design modular and loosely coupled applications. 

Next, we'll focus on selected Spring: We'll start with Spring Web and learn how to develop robust and scalable web applications using Spring MVC's features, including request mapping, data binding, validation, and handling RESTful APIs. Then we will delve into Spring Data, a powerful module that simplifies data access and persistence. We will learn how to work with relational databases using Spring JDBC, JPA, and Hibernate, and how to leverage Spring Data repositories for efficient CRUD operations. Participants will gain insights into transaction management and advanced querying techniques.

The course introduces participants to other essential libraries and tools. For example, we will explore Lombok, a library that streamlines Java development by automatically generating common code patterns. We will also learn about Flyway, a powerful database migration tool, and how to integrate it with Spring applications for efficient schema management.

Throughout the course, participants will work on hands-on projects and coding assignments that simulate real-world scenarios, allowing them to apply their knowledge and skills in practical situations. They will also gain insights into testing methodologies, debugging techniques, and performance optimization strategies specific to Spring-based applications.

Upon completion of the course, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of advanced Java concepts and the expertise to build enterprise-grade applications using the Spring framework. Whether pursuing a career as a Java developer, a Spring developer, or an enterprise application architect, this course provides a solid foundation for mastering modern Java development.
