title: Advanced C++
---

The Advanced C++ course offers a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of modern C++ programming techniques and the underlying fundamentals that power this versatile language. Designed for experienced developers looking to elevate their C++ skills, this course covers a range of advanced topics to enable participants to write efficient, maintainable, and robust C++ code. The course can be customized to include one or more of the follwoing topics, allowing organizers to focus on areas that align with their specific interests and learning goals.

The course begins with an overview of Modern C++ (C++11 onwards), highlighting key language features and improvements that have been introduced. Participants will delve into the latest standards and understand how to leverage the power of modern C++ to write expressive and concise code.

One of the core focuses of the course is mastering the principles of Effective C++. Participants will learn effective coding practices and design guidelines to enhance code readability, performance, and maintainability. Through real-world examples and hands-on exercises, participants will gain insights into utilizing C++ effectively and avoiding common pitfalls.

Another significant aspect of the course is exploring template internals. Templates are a powerful tool in C++ that enable generic programming. Participants will gain a deep understanding of template metaprogramming techniques, including template specialization, variadic templates, and SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error). By understanding template internals, participants will be able to harness the full potential of templates and write highly flexible and reusable code.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of C++, it is essential to look "under the hood" and examine the internals of the language. The course dives into compiled code, enabling participants to comprehend how C++ code is transformed and optimized during compilation. For example, participants will gain insights into exception implementations, allowing them to understand the mechanisms behind exception handling in C++ and make informed design decisions.

Lastly, the course explores the relationship between C++ and its predecessor, C. Participants will examine the similarities and differences between the two languages, understanding how C++ builds upon the foundations of C while providing additional features and benefits. Through comparative analysis and practical examples, participants will appreciate the advantages of using C++ over C for various programming tasks (and overcome their fear of hidden performance costs).

By the end of the Advanced C++ course, participants will have acquired a deep understanding of modern C++ techniques, effective coding practices, template metaprogramming, and the internals of the language. Armed with this knowledge, participants will be well-equipped to write high-quality, efficient, and maintainable C++ code, harnessing the full potential of the language.
