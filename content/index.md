Hi! My name is Assaf Tzur-El. I am a software architect, developer, lecturer, and mentor (not necessarily in that order). I live in Israel and work (mostly remotely) all over the world. **Simple. Technology** is my official brand name, but I also provide my services via other companies.

I speacialize in taking projects and products to the next level: High-risk projects, technology stack updates, bleeding edge tech, or just computerizing a manual process into a single button-click.

TL;DR version of my career: 15 years in the hi-tech industry, from a developer to a team leader, architect, project manager, and back. Then, in 2009, I became a freelance consultant, sharing my experience in software development while expanding my skill set to include teaching and mentoring.

You can find my full résumé in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/assaftzurel/). Descriptions of the lectures and courses I have given so far can be found in the [Lectures](/lectures) and [Courses](/courses) pages.
