title: Transforming Software Organizations Through Technology and Leadership
---

Hi! I'm Assaf Tzur-El, a veteran software development consultant with 30 years of industry experience. I help organizations and individuals who want to change the world through technology by creating order from chaos, optimizing development processes, and enabling teams to reach their full potential.

## Expert Software Consulting and Technical Leadership

As a software architect, technical leader, and mentor, I specialize in transforming high-risk projects and challenging technological initiatives into manageable, successful outcomes. Whether you're scaling your startup, modernizing your tech stack, or seeking to optimize your development processes, I bring battle-tested expertise from three decades in the industry.

### What Sets Me Apart

Before teaching or consulting on any technology or methodology, I ensure I understand it at a fundamental level - not just the theory, but the practical applications and potential pitfalls. My approach combines deep technical knowledge with real-world experience, including:

- Software architecture design and implementation
- Development process optimization and friction reduction
- Technical leadership and team mentoring
- Organizational transformation and scaling
- High-risk project recovery and management

## Comprehensive Software Consulting Services

### Process Optimization and Technical Leadership
I help development organizations identify and eliminate friction points, implement metrics-driven improvements through OKRs and KPIs, and establish best practices that enhance both code quality and developer growth.

### Architecture and Technology Solutions
From designing scalable architectures to modernizing legacy systems, I ensure your technical decisions align with long-term organizational goals and business needs.

### Training and Mentorship
My greatest passion is sharing knowledge. I offer personalized training and mentorship programs, combining theoretical foundations with practical, hands-on exercises based on real-world scenarios.

## Experience That Makes a Difference

Having served across the technical spectrum – from hands-on developer to CTO – I've helped organizations of all sizes, from startups to global enterprises. With effective collaboration tools and methodologies, I work successfully with clients both locally in Israel and worldwide, offering flexible engagement models: on-site, remote, or hybrid - adapting to each organization's specific needs and preferences.

When I'm not optimizing code or processes, I contribute to the tech community by judging robotics competitions, speaking at international conferences and meetups, mentoring the next generation of developers, and sharing insights through technical courses and workshops.
