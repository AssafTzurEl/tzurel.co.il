Hi! My name is Assaf Tzur-El. I am a software architect, developer, lecturer, and mentor (not necessarily in that order). I live in Israel and work (mostly remotely) all over the world. **Simple. Technology** is my official brand name, but I also provide my services via other companies.

I speacialize in taking projects and products to the next level: High-risk projects, technology stack updates, bleeding edge tech, or just computerizing a manual process into a single button-click. But my greatest passion (and the reason I created this site) is teaching and mentoring.

TL;DR version of my career: 15 years in the hi-tech industry, from a developer to a team leader, architect, project manager, and back. Then, in 2009, I became a freelance consultant, sharing my experience in software development while expanding my skill set to include teaching and mentoring. I have been doing that ever since.

## My "special sauce"

I'll let you in on my secret: Before I commit to teaching anything, I make sure I know at least 110% of the material. I don't just teach from the book, I teach from experience. I have been there, done that. I have made the mistakes, and I have learned from them. Then I build the course or the lecture, imagining a younger version of myself, and what I would have wanted to know back then.

In my courses, lectures, and mentoring, I give a lot of real-life examples, mostly from my own experience (including my own mistakes). Then I give that experience to my students in the form of well-crafted exercises. Theory is nothing without practice, and I strongly believe that the best way to learn is by doing - and then getting immediate feedback.

## What's next?
