title: SOLID/fragile

### Abstract:

Let's break down the SOLID principles, one by one – and then really _break_ them

### Motivation:

Being a "good" programmer, we're told, is all about religiously adhering to sacred principles such as SOLID and Design Patterns. But sometimes we lay awake at night, wondering what constitutes a "single responsibility"? Is quick sort Liskov-substitutable for bubble sort? How many one-method interfaces are we allowed before our code is considered over-segregated?

In this lecture, we investigate the SOLID principles one by one, and understand when to apply them – and when not to.

### Target audience:

C#, Java, C++, and other OO language developers with an open mind.

### Topics:

For each of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID principles</a> (Single responsibility, Open/closed principle, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and Dependency inversion), we answer the following questions:

- What is the meaning of the principle?
- Why is it a Good Thing?
- When should we apply it?
- When should we ignore it? (or: How do we avoid abusing it?)
