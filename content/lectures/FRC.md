title: Fixing the world (one robot at a time)
---

Would you like to change the world? So did Dean Kamen. But unlike most of us, who would just complain and then forget about it, Dean is an engineer and an entrepreneur: When he sees a problem, he fixes it. And so, 30 years ago, he started his journey to fix the world. His goal was simple: Raise a generation of kids who’ll admire science and technology at least as much as they admire rock stars; promote professionalism and hard work alongside generosity and cooperation; and while we’re at it, encourage them to help the community, fight climate change, and many other worthy goals.

Spoiler: It's working.

In this lecture, we meet Dean Kamen, talk about his dream and how he decided to accomplish it, how it works, and why you (and your kids) want be part of it.
