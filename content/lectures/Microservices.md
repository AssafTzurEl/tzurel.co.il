title: To Microservice, or not to Microservice
---

### Abstract:

A new project; a new addition to an existing project; maybe it's an old system that should be retired and rewritten. The motive doesn't matter, the means are obvious: Microservices! The latest and greatest architectural fashion, with buzzwords such as Kubernetes and Cloud. This is a great opportunity to get into action and live on the bleeding edge!

Before you're rushing forward with that project, I would like to tell you about two projects. We'll talk about the motives and need to modernize each one; get to know the considerations and constraints that affected the decision whether to go for a microservice architecture or go the more traditional route;
and most important: We'll learn a few lessons, so that in our next project, we'll be able to make an educated decision: To microservice, or not to microservice?

### Target audience:

Anyone in a position to comtemplate, or make a decision, regarding modernization of existing systems. Those who are about to start developing a brand new system. People who are enchanted by buzzwords and bleeding-edge technologies, and of course those who are wary of the same things.
