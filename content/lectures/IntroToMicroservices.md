title: Introduction to microservice
---

### Abstract:

Microservices have become a popular architectural style for developing large-scale applications. In this lecture, we will discuss the concept of microservices, its benefits and drawbacks, and how it differs from traditional monolithic architectures. We will explore the key principles of microservices such as independence, scalability, and fault tolerance. We will also examine the challenges of designing, testing, deploying, and monitoring microservices. Additionally, we will discuss the use of containerization and orchestration technologies like Docker and Kubernetes in microservices architecture. By the end of this lecture, attendees will gain a solid understanding of microservices and be able to identify potential use cases and challenges when adopting this architectural style.

### Target audience:

Software architects, developers, product owners, DevOps engineers, and anyone who is involved in the design, development, and deployment of large-scale applications.
