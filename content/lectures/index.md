## General audience lectures:

<details>
    <summary>From Chaos to calm: A guide to effective time management</summary>

    <div>
        <p>
            Do you ever feel like there are not enough hours in the day? Are you struggling to manage your workload and
            meet deadlines? The good news is that you're not alone: We all do. Time is a limited resource, but modern
            life demand more and more of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll start by figuring out what takes up all of our time and makes us so frustrated. Then, we'll discover
            how we can maximize productivity and efficiency by learning practical strategies for effective time
            management. From setting goals and prioritizing tasks to minimizing distractions and leveraging technology,
            this lecture will provide you with actionable insights to help you take control of your time and achieve
            your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, as the saying goes: "If not now, when"? We'll start implementing those insights right away, each one
            with his or her own life and personal tasks. Mental relief assured.

<details>
    <summary>Fixing the world (one robot at a time)</summary>

    <div>
        <p>
            Would you like to change the world? So did Dean Kamen. But unlike most of us, who would just complain and
            then forget about it, Dean is an engineer and an entrepreneur: When he sees a problem, he fixes it. And so,
            30 years ago, he started his journey to fix the world. His goal was simple: Raise a generation of kids
            who’ll admire science and technology at least as much as they admire rock stars; promote professionalism
            and hard work alongside generosity and cooperation; and while we’re at it, encourage them to help the
            community, fight climate change, and many other worthy goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spoiler: It's working.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this lecture, we meet Dean Kamen, talk about his dream and how he decided to accomplish it,
            how it works, and why you (and your kids) want be part of it.

    <summary>Digital analogy</summary>

    <div>
        <p>
            - "Computers? I don't get along with them"<br/>
            - "Technology is cold and heartless"<br/>
            - "I'm technophobic"<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
             This lecture challenge the common perception that technology is a purely scientific endeavor. It explores
             the fascinating and often surprising ways in which digital technology is influenced by the humanities.
             Together, we will see how works of literature, folklore, and art have had a profound impact on the
             development of digital technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope the lecture will inspire you to think creatively about the intersection of technology and the
            humanities, and to improve your relationship with future innovation.

## Architecture and design lectures:

<details>
    <summary>SOLID/fragile</summary>

    <div>
        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>
            Let's break down the SOLID principles, one by one – and then really break them
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation:</h3>
        <p>
            Being a "good" programmer, we're told, is all about religiously adhering to sacred principles such as SOLID
            and Design Patterns. But sometimes we lay awake at night, wondering what constitutes a
            "single responsibility"? Is quick sort Liskov-substitutable for bubble sort? How many one-method interfaces
            are we allowed before our code is considered over-segregated?
        </p>
        <p>
            In this lecture, we investigate the SOLID principles one by one, and understand when to apply them – and
            when not to.
        </p>
        <h3>Target audience:</h3>
        <p>
            C#, Java, C++, and other OO language developers with an open mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Topics:</h3>
        <p>
            For each of the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) (Single responsibility,
            Open/closed principal, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and Dependency inversion),
            we answer the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>What is the meaning of the principle?</li>
                <li>Why is it a Good Thing?</li>
                <li>When should we apply it?</li>
                <li>When should we ignore it? (or: How do we avoid abusing it?)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
</details>

### Microservices:

<details>
    <summary>To Microservice, or not to Microservice</summary>

    <div>
        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>
            A new project; a new addition to an existing project; maybe it's an old system that should be retired and
            rewritten. The motive doesn't matter, the means are obvious: Microservices! The latest and greatest
            architectural fashion, with buzzwords such as Kubernetes and Cloud. This is a great opportunity to get
            into action and live on the bleeding edge!
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you're rushing forward with that project, I would like to tell you about two projects. We'll talk
            about the motives and need to modernize each one; get to know the considerations and constraints that
            affected the decision whether to go for a microservice architecture or go the more traditional route;
            and most important: We'll learn a few lessons, so that in our next project, we'll be able to make an
            educated decision: To microservice, or not to microservice?
        </p>
        <h3>Target audience:</h3>
        <p>
            Anyone in a position to comtemplate, or make a decision, regarding modernization of existing systems.
            Those who are about to start developing a brand new system. People who are enchanted by buzzwords and
            bleeding-edge technologies, and of course those who are wary of the same things.
        </p>

Title
Instructions: The title should be expressive and catchy - some kind of an initial teaser.

Abstract
Instructions: The abstract is 1-3 paragraph long session description (some of you liked the analogy of being the presentation "elevator pitch"), which should answer the following: 
0.	What is the problem/challenge/issue you're addressing?
1.	What is the presented solution/concept?
2.	What content will you present?
3.	Who is the target audience? (if relevant)
4.	What's in it for me?


גמישות באג'ייל
אג'ייל היא מתודולוגיה שדוגלת בגמישות – אבל הפרקטיקה שלה מכתיבה התנהלות מאוד ספציפית. האם מותר לחרוג ממנה ומתי? בהרצאה נפרק את אג'ייל לעקרונות, נחקור את משמעותם  ונראה איך אפשר להשתמש בכל אחד מהם בפרויקטים לא אג'יליים או בחברה לא אג'ילית.
