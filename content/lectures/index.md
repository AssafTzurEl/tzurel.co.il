## General audience lectures:

<details>
    <summary>Fixing the world (one robot at a time)</summary>

    <div>
        <p>
            Would you like to change the world? So did Dean Kamen. But unlike most of us, who would just complain and
            then forget about it, Dean is an engineer and an entrepreneur: When he sees a problem, he fixes it. And so,
            30 years ago, he started his journey to fix the world. His goal was simple: Raise a generation of kids
            who’ll admire science and technology at least as much as they admire rock stars; promote professionalism
            and hard work alongside generosity and cooperation; and while we’re at it, encourage them to help the
            community, fight climate change, and many other worthy goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spoiler: It's working.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this lecture, we meet Dean Kamen, talk about his dream and how he decided to accomplish it,
            how it works, and why you (and your kids) want be part of it.
        </p>

## Architecture and design lectures:

<details>
    <summary>SOLID/fragile</summary>

    <div>
        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>
            Let's break down the SOLID principles, one by one – and then really break them
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation:</h3>
        <p>
            Being a "good" programmer, we're told, is all about religiously adhering to sacred principles such as SOLID
            and Design Patterns. But sometimes we lay awake at night, wondering what constitutes a
            "single responsibility"? Is quick sort Liskov-substitutable for bubble sort? How many one-method interfaces
            are we allowed before our code is considered over-segregated?
        </p>
        <p>
            In this lecture, we investigate the SOLID principles one by one, and understand when to apply them – and
            when not to.
        </p>
        <h3>Target audience:</h3>
        <p>
            C#, Java, C++, and other OO language developers with an open mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Topics:</h3>
        <p>
            For each of the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) (Single responsibility,
            Open/closed principal, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and Dependency inversion),
            we answer the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>What is the meaning of the principle?</li>
                <li>Why is it a Good Thing?</li>
                <li>When should we apply it?</li>
                <li>When should we ignore it? (or: How do we avoid abusing it?)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
</details>

### Microservices:

<details>
    <summary>To Microservice, or not to Microservice</summary>

    <div>
        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>
            A new project; a new addition to an existing project; maybe it's an old system that should be retired and
            rewritten. The motive doesn't matter, the means are obvious: Microservices! The latest and greatest
            architectural fashion, with buzzwords such as Kubernetes and Cloud. This is a great opportunity to get
            into action and live on the bleeding edge!
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you're rushing forward with that project, I would like to tell you about two projects. We'll talk
            about the motives and need to modernize each one; get to know the considerations and constraints that
            affected the decision whether to go for a microservice architecture or go the more traditional route;
            and most important: We'll learn a few lessons, so that in our next project, we'll be able to make an
            educated decision: To microservice, or not to microservice?
        </p>
        <h3>Target audience:</h3>
        <p>
            Anyone in a position to comtemplate, or make a decision, regarding modernization of existing systems.
            Those who are about to start developing a brand new system. People who are enchanted by buzzwords and
            bleeding-edge technologies, and of course those who are wary of the same things.
        </p>

ניהול זמן
זמן הוא משאב מוגבל, אבל החיים שלנו דורשים יותר ויותר ממנו. בהרצאה נלמד לאן הזמן שלנו בורח, איך מנהלים אותו נכון ואיך נוכל לייעל את ההתנהלות שלנו ואפילו ליהנות מהתהליך. וכמו שאומרים, "אם לא עכשיו אז מתי?" ולכן, נתחיל מייד ליישם – כל אחד על החיים והמשימות האישיות שלו. הקלה מובטחת.

הרביעית:
גמישות באג'ייל
אג'ייל היא מתודולוגיה שדוגלת בגמישות – אבל הפרקטיקה שלה מכתיבה התנהלות מאוד ספציפית. האם מותר לחרוג ממנה ומתי? בהרצאה נפרק את אג'ייל לעקרונות, נחקור את משמעותם  ונראה איך אפשר להשתמש בכל אחד מהם בפרויקטים לא אג'יליים או בחברה לא אג'ילית.
